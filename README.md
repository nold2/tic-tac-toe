# tic-tac-toe
A 3x3 tic tac toe game on terminal based on python

Only 3 conditions exist "Draw", "X wins", "O wins"


### Validation
Input should be a coordinate number ranging from 1 to 3 separated by space, e.g. `1 3`

There will be a validation to handle the input such as `two three` or `1 4` or `2,3`

### Available moves
The available coordinates are as follows: 

`1 3` `2 3` `3 3`

`1 2` `2 2` `3 2`

`1 1` `1 1` `3 1`

### How it works
To run the game just do `python tictactoe.py`

### Requirements
Worked on python 3.8.5 and python 3.6.8
